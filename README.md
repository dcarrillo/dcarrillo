### This is Dani :alien:

I hope you're doing well. I'm Daniel Carrillo, a senior platform engineer (though once a sysadmin, always a sysadmin).

- I particularly specialize in cloud and on-prem architecture for `distributed systems`.
- These days I write yaml files for a living (`kubernetes` all over).
- I also write platform tools (mostly in `golang`), fine-tune complex systems, and help developers embrace (and make real) the concept of `you build it you run it`.
- `DevOps` is a culture, not a role.
- I do love free (as in freedom and as in a beer) software and `Linux` systems.
- If you want to learn more about my professional career, you can check out my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielcarrillo/) profile.
